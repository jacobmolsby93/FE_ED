# Fe_ED

A Discussion page, where users can sign up. Create a user profile, upload a profile image and write a short biography. Inspired by the website Reddit,
developed with a simpler approach with the possibility of scaling. As well as uploading and reading other posts, users can engage with other users in the form of comments and likes throughout the different posts. Features that will be implemented shortly is the ability to see others users' pages.
As well as a more categorized sorting system of the posts created.

## Testing 

Testing has been done by me, althou most of the developing of this project has been to trying to figure out how django works. I had created multiple users to check that they all connect to the database and that the right information is shown on the right places. The urls has been tested back and fort to ensure that everything works, the good thing about django is that when something is really wrong it lets you know that it is. 
Again on this project ive had my brother as an outsider come and look at the application and tell me whwat he thinks, about the parts that work. the parts that dont work is something i will have study more. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - Errors return only for django input [W3C validator](https://github.com/jacobmolsby93/milestone4/blob/main/media/images/readme-images/Sk%C3%A4rmbild%20(42).png?raw=true)
- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://github.com/jacobmolsby93/milestone4/blob/main/media/images/readme-images/css-validator.png?raw=true)

### Unfixed Bugs
There will be a few unfixed bugs, becase I couldnt complete the project in time for the deadline. This has been really hard to grasp and to understand fully. Im not expecting a pass on this subject and would happyily redo it as soon as possible.
Nevertheless I'l list all the bugs here.

- Profile page is not complete. i could not get the posts from the user and showed on a list view. under the bio description.
- The website is not made to a responsive design to this point. I was focusing on getting the django logic to work.


## Deployment
The web application is deployed using heroku.

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
